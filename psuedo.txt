Following are the steps to build a calculator: 

Build functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication and subtraction. 
Built. 

Assign variables to be passed into functions. 
numOne, numTwo, operand

set up html and css. 

Let's do js now. 

Let's make it work for one digit each. 

Event listener on all buttons - giving them values. 



When you press equal, the function operate runs with the variables a, b and operand. 

Maybe I can create an array of inputs. And go from there. And then can empty array at the end. 

Should probably use queryselector all and the target attribute to simplify js. (later)
